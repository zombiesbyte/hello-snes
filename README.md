# Hello SNES

## Attract Mode Theme

### YouTube Video None
#### version 1.0

A layout based on the original Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The layout uses a custom grid navigation system and provides a minimal amount of optional parameters to customise your experience.

The layout code should be fairly straight forward to follow if your a newbie to Squirrel programming language and Attract Mode theme/layout building. Even if you do not want to do anything with the code then you can use your own assets to change things up such as telling the them to use 3dboxes as shown in the video showcase or swap out a similar image in the parts folder.

## Assets (Emulator Configuration)

Attract Mode has default asset names which include snap, marquee, flyer, etc... Since this theme will draw upon more than what is already setup by default then you will need to provide attract mode with these additional asset references.

**logo** - This is the transparent logo above the video snap

**cart** - This referes to the cartridge images

Of course this is just a guide and should you want to modify any of these settings or pull in alternative types of images then this can be easily done from the layout.nut file contained within this directory. The second near the top under "//external assets" references these assets

Enjoy!
